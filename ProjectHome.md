FTL is a library to represent knowledge using the Feature Term formalism. It supports the creation of ontologies, and the basic operations with feature terms: subsumption, antiunification and unification. Additionally, it implements a collection of refinement operators which can be used as the basis of many learning and reasoning algorithms.

As a bonus, fterm comes with a collection of learning algorithms already coded as examples: similarity evaluations, FOIL (HIDRA), LID, INDIE, ABUI, AMAIL, and also a package to perform argumentation using feature terms. Translators from terms to other formats such as Horn Clauses, or even LaTeX figures are also included.

Finally, a collection of datasets represented as feature terms is included (most from the UCI machine learning repository). Find them in the NOOS subfolder

The library was developed by [Santiago Ontañón](https://sites.google.com/site/santiagoontanonvillar/Home) in collaboration with [Enric Plaza](http://www.iiia.csic.es/~enric/Enric-IIIA/Enric_%40_IIIA.html), and with contributions by Carlos López del Toro.
